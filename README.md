# Docker PHP-FPM 7.4 & Nginx 1.18 on Alpine Linux
This is a container image, built on top of [docker-php-nginx](https://github.com/TrafeX/docker-php-nginx/) that adds some common php modules that I use in my projects. It can be used as a sample project for how to add php modules to docker-php-nginx.

GitHub actions is used to build and keep up-to-date. If you get stuck on how to use this, first try the excekent docker-php-nginx by Tim de Pater.
